## SQL Challenges from lecture

1. List the total number of songs
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_songs
FROM songs;
```

2. List the songs with a rating over 9
```sql
SELECT *
FROM songs
WHERE rating > 9;
```

3. List all of the albums from before 2010
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM albums
WHERE release_date < 'January 1, 2010';
```

4. List the albums from before 2010 and have a genre of "folk"
```sql
SELECT *
FROM albums
WHERE release_date < 'January 1, 2010' AND genre = 'folk';s
```

5. List the albums that have genre of "folk" arranged alphabetically by artist and then by release date newest to oldest.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM albums
WHERE genre = 'folk'
ORDER BY artist_name, release_date DESC;
```

6. List all albums to be released.
```sql
SELECT *, CURRENT_DATE
FROM albums
WHERE release_date > CURRENT_DATE;

SELECT *, NOW()
FROM albums
WHERE release_date > NOW();
```

7. List all of the genres, don't repeat any.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT genre 
FROM albums;
```

8. List all of the albums along with their songs.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id;
```

9. List all of the albums along with how many songs each album has.
```sql
SELECT album_name, COUNT(songs.id) AS num_songs
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name;
```

10. List all of the albums with more than 10 songs.
```sql
SELECT album_name, COUNT(songs.id) AS num_songs
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name
HAVING COUNT(songs.id) > 10;
```

11. List ALL albums along with their songs
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM albums
LEFT JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id;
```

12. List albums along with their average song rating.
```sql
SELECT album_name, artist_name, AVG(rating)
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name, artist_name;

SELECT album_name, artist_name, ROUND(AVG(rating) * 1000) / 1000
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name, artist_name;
```

13. List albums and songs with ratings higher than their albums average.
```sql
SELECT album_name,
  artist_name,
  rating,
  (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM songs WHERE songs.album_id = albums.id) AS song_avg_rating
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
WHERE rating > (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM songs WHERE songs.album_id = albums.id);
